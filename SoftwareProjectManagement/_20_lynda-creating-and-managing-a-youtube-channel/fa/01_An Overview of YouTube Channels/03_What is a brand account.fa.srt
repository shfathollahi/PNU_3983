1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.03
- In the past, it was possible

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:06.01
to set up multiple YouTube
channels tied to one ID

3
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:09.00
but Google recently made
a change to brand accounts

4
00:00:09.00 --> 00:00:10.08
that makes it a little bit easier

5
00:00:10.08 --> 00:00:14.01
to manage channels as well
as other Google properties

6
00:00:14.01 --> 00:00:16.00
that you might be taking advantage of.

7
00:00:16.00 --> 00:00:19.08
For example, Google+ pages
plus Google photo pages

8
00:00:19.08 --> 00:00:22.02
and Google business pages
can all tie together

9
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:24.02
into a YouTube channel as well.

10
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:25.05
And what really happens here

11
00:00:25.05 --> 00:00:28.04
is you might have a few
managers behind the scenes

12
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:31.02
who control an overall channel.

13
00:00:31.02 --> 00:00:34.02
Well, this is all done through
the use of a brand account

14
00:00:34.02 --> 00:00:36.09
and it's important that you
know how to set these up.

15
00:00:36.09 --> 00:00:38.09
What is a brand account?

16
00:00:38.09 --> 00:00:40.09
Well, a brand account is
pretty straight forward

17
00:00:40.09 --> 00:00:43.03
and if you're familiar with
a tool like a Facebook page,

18
00:00:43.03 --> 00:00:45.07
it's almost the same concept.

19
00:00:45.07 --> 00:00:48.06
In this case, these are separate accounts

20
00:00:48.06 --> 00:00:51.08
that are managed by one
or more personal account.

21
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:53.07
So, for example, when we're publishing

22
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:55.03
under the Photo Focus brand,

23
00:00:55.03 --> 00:00:57.04
I've got multiple editors and authors

24
00:00:57.04 --> 00:01:00.07
who can access the same page.

25
00:01:00.07 --> 00:01:03.00
These are typically used
for business purposes

26
00:01:03.00 --> 00:01:06.03
or branding purposes so you're
not representing yourself

27
00:01:06.03 --> 00:01:08.05
as an individual.

28
00:01:08.05 --> 00:01:13.00
And they end up being connected
to a personal Google account

29
00:01:13.00 --> 00:01:18.05
but that account is not
displayed to the audience.

30
00:01:18.05 --> 00:01:21.01
Additionally, the management
on a brand account

31
00:01:21.01 --> 00:01:22.09
can be shared.

32
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:24.09
Now, Google services that are compatible

33
00:01:24.09 --> 00:01:26.08
with these brand accounts are many

34
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:28.09
and, in fact, I suspect that Google,

35
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:30.05
as they add additional services,

36
00:01:30.05 --> 00:01:33.01
will start to connect them all together.

37
00:01:33.01 --> 00:01:34.09
A brand account can currently be used

38
00:01:34.09 --> 00:01:37.09
with Google+, Google's
social networking platform,

39
00:01:37.09 --> 00:01:40.08
although this platform has
taken a bit of a hit lately

40
00:01:40.08 --> 00:01:44.03
in traffic and overall market penetration.

41
00:01:44.03 --> 00:01:46.06
Google Photos, which is important

42
00:01:46.06 --> 00:01:48.05
if you are sharing images or want people

43
00:01:48.05 --> 00:01:52.06
to be able to discover images
of your product or company.

44
00:01:52.06 --> 00:01:54.09
Google My Business,
which serves as a profile

45
00:01:54.09 --> 00:01:58.01
so that people can find
your local business,

46
00:01:58.01 --> 00:02:00.03
or multiple locations and get in touch

47
00:02:00.03 --> 00:02:05.01
for physical sales, visits
or retail locations.

48
00:02:05.01 --> 00:02:06.09
And YouTube.

49
00:02:06.09 --> 00:02:09.02
Now, you probably understand the concept

50
00:02:09.02 --> 00:02:11.03
of a brand account, but let me show you

51
00:02:11.03 --> 00:02:14.00
how we can actually put this into action.

52
00:02:14.00 --> 00:02:16.07
To create a brand account
is pretty straight forward.

53
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:21.00
You're going to login
into your YouTube account,

54
00:02:21.00 --> 00:02:24.08
visit the YouTube channel switcher,

55
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:30.00
and from this page, you can
choose to create a new channel.

56
00:02:30.00 --> 00:02:33.02
You can enter any relevant
information about the channel

57
00:02:33.02 --> 00:02:35.09
and then publish it.

58
00:02:35.09 --> 00:02:37.08
You also can visit another URL

59
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:41.07
to really see all of your brand
accounts at a global view.

60
00:02:41.07 --> 00:02:45.04
So, let's start with that first
URL, the channel switcher.

61
00:02:45.04 --> 00:02:47.01
When you visit the channel switcher,

62
00:02:47.01 --> 00:02:49.00
you have the ability to switch between

63
00:02:49.00 --> 00:02:52.09
any existing channels
associated with your Google ID.

64
00:02:52.09 --> 00:02:55.03
Right now I'm gonna show
you several channels

65
00:02:55.03 --> 00:02:57.06
that I work with, some
of them are clients,

66
00:02:57.06 --> 00:02:59.04
some of them are ones that I manage,

67
00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:01.07
but it's a good illustration
of how you can have access

68
00:03:01.07 --> 00:03:03.07
to more than one account.

69
00:03:03.07 --> 00:03:06.03
As you see here, up top,

70
00:03:06.03 --> 00:03:08.01
I've got some individual channels

71
00:03:08.01 --> 00:03:11.03
that have been created and down below

72
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:13.02
we have some brand accounts.

73
00:03:13.02 --> 00:03:14.08
I've got some accounts for projects

74
00:03:14.08 --> 00:03:18.06
that I've set up Google+ pages
for or brand accounts for

75
00:03:18.06 --> 00:03:21.07
but I've not yet created
a YouTube page for.

76
00:03:21.07 --> 00:03:23.09
Up here, you can see multiple channels

77
00:03:23.09 --> 00:03:25.01
that I've been added to.

78
00:03:25.01 --> 00:03:27.02
Some of them are ones that I control.

79
00:03:27.02 --> 00:03:29.09
Some are ones that belong to a client.

80
00:03:29.09 --> 00:03:32.02
Currently, I'm using Photo Focus,

81
00:03:32.02 --> 00:03:35.00
our daily site on photography education.

82
00:03:35.00 --> 00:03:38.06
And you'll see that that ID is
selected in the upper corner.

83
00:03:38.06 --> 00:03:40.07
Now, if we switch from
mobile for a moment,

84
00:03:40.07 --> 00:03:44.00
you'll see that I did a
search for Skylum software.

85
00:03:44.00 --> 00:03:46.07
As such, we got several hits here

86
00:03:46.07 --> 00:03:48.09
for different types of content,

87
00:03:48.09 --> 00:03:51.03
videos about Skylum software,

88
00:03:51.03 --> 00:03:55.02
but there's also a page
here and the company logo.

89
00:03:55.02 --> 00:03:57.08
This is an example of a brand account

90
00:03:57.08 --> 00:04:01.00
and when I tap this, you'll
see on the mobile device

91
00:04:01.00 --> 00:04:04.04
that YouTube shows me another channel.

92
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:06.00
There's artwork at the top,

93
00:04:06.00 --> 00:04:09.04
the ability to navigate
between videos and playlists

94
00:04:09.04 --> 00:04:12.03
as well as a trailer and
several different pieces

95
00:04:12.03 --> 00:04:15.00
of artwork that have been
featured and organized.

96
00:04:15.00 --> 00:04:17.02
In this case, different
playlists of videos

97
00:04:17.02 --> 00:04:20.05
that have been gathered together
for audiences to consume

98
00:04:20.05 --> 00:04:23.06
as well as some additional
playlists on the bottom.

99
00:04:23.06 --> 00:04:25.09
Now if we visit this on a desktop,

100
00:04:25.09 --> 00:04:28.05
you'll see a similar experience.

101
00:04:28.05 --> 00:04:32.01
If I do a search on YouTube.com
on a desktop browser,

102
00:04:32.01 --> 00:04:34.05
you'll see similar results.

103
00:04:34.05 --> 00:04:36.09
And when I select the channel,

104
00:04:36.09 --> 00:04:39.09
now in this case, it's
taken me to the channel

105
00:04:39.09 --> 00:04:43.01
with a slightly different
interface than you saw on mobile

106
00:04:43.01 --> 00:04:45.04
but it's the same general idea.

107
00:04:45.04 --> 00:04:47.01
We have a graphic identity.

108
00:04:47.01 --> 00:04:48.06
We have the use of a trailer

109
00:04:48.06 --> 00:04:50.08
and we have different videos and playlists

110
00:04:50.08 --> 00:04:53.05
that are organized for easy consumption.

111
00:04:53.05 --> 00:04:56.02
If you'd like to see your
overall brand accounts,

112
00:04:56.02 --> 00:05:01.04
you can visit
myaccount.google.com/brandaccounts

113
00:05:01.04 --> 00:05:03.05
and here you can see invitations

114
00:05:03.05 --> 00:05:06.09
as well as email preferences
about which things

115
00:05:06.09 --> 00:05:09.02
you're going to be notified about.

116
00:05:09.02 --> 00:05:11.04
Let's go back a level here.

117
00:05:11.04 --> 00:05:13.02
And you can see the
different brand accounts

118
00:05:13.02 --> 00:05:15.07
that I've been connected to.

119
00:05:15.07 --> 00:05:17.08
Now, what's most likely going to happen

120
00:05:17.08 --> 00:05:22.05
is the need to create a new brand account.

121
00:05:22.05 --> 00:05:24.07
Remember, the easiest place to do that

122
00:05:24.07 --> 00:05:27.01
is from the YouTube channel switcher.

123
00:05:27.01 --> 00:05:29.06
This will give you access
to all of your brands

124
00:05:29.06 --> 00:05:32.02
and the ability to create a new channel.

125
00:05:32.02 --> 00:05:34.04
Now, if you switch a Google ID,

126
00:05:34.04 --> 00:05:39.04
for example, let me switch
here to another project.

127
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:40.07
You'll see, in this case,

128
00:05:40.07 --> 00:05:43.09
that only a single YouTube channel exists.

129
00:05:43.09 --> 00:05:47.01
I could, of course,
create another new channel

130
00:05:47.01 --> 00:05:50.07
and it'll create the
corresponding brand account.

131
00:05:50.07 --> 00:05:52.05
To do this is pretty simple.

132
00:05:52.05 --> 00:05:59.01
Start by entering a name.

133
00:05:59.01 --> 00:06:03.07
Click create.

134
00:06:03.07 --> 00:06:05.04
And you'll now see that you have

135
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:08.07
an empty YouTube channel awaiting content.

136
00:06:08.07 --> 00:06:10.02
Creating a new channel

137
00:06:10.02 --> 00:06:12.09
is also going to create
a new brand account.

138
00:06:12.09 --> 00:06:15.05
They go hand in hand and in fact,

139
00:06:15.05 --> 00:06:18.03
when you first went to
upload a video to YouTube,

140
00:06:18.03 --> 00:06:21.07
it likely asked you to
create a channel in doing so.

141
00:06:21.07 --> 00:06:23.09
So chances are, if
you've already uploaded,

142
00:06:23.09 --> 00:06:26.09
you may already have a
channel and a brand account

143
00:06:26.09 --> 00:06:29.06
but it might not be the
branding that you want.

144
00:06:29.06 --> 00:06:32.02
So, using the steps that
you've learned in this lesson,

145
00:06:32.02 --> 00:06:34.04
it's easy to see an existing brand,

146
00:06:34.04 --> 00:06:37.07
to switch to another or
to create a whole new one

147
00:06:37.07 --> 00:06:40.01
to hold the videos and the artwork

148
00:06:40.01 --> 00:06:43.05
for a particular topic or
particular brand or company.
