00:00:00.0 --> 00:00:03.0
We could all site my projects we’ve been on

1
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:06.0
have failed and research studies give us many

2
00:00:06.0 --> 00:00:09.0
clues as well but have you ever really

3
00:00:09.0 --> 00:00:12.0
looked at how the PM and BA relationship could

4
00:00:12.0 --> 00:00:15.0
contribute to these failures and possibly even

5
00:00:15.0 --> 00:00:18.0
prevent them let’s look at a few ideas

6
00:00:18.0 --> 00:00:21.0
first - lack of stakeholder engagement

7
00:00:21.0 --> 00:00:24.0
and involvement and this includes engage

8
00:00:24.0 --> 00:00:27.0
sponsor and sponsors having clear vision

9
00:00:27.0 --> 00:00:30.0
and objectives. the BA and PM

10
00:00:30.0 --> 00:00:33.0
have key roles and helping the leaders

11
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:36.0
take the vision and objectives and

12
00:00:36.0 --> 00:00:39.0
turn them from strategy to execution

13
00:00:39.0 --> 00:00:42.0
stakeholder involvement at the leader and contributor

14
00:00:42.0 --> 00:00:45.0
levels is key to making the strategy and vision

15
00:00:45.0 --> 00:00:48.0
a reality . the PM

16
00:00:48.0 --> 00:00:51.0
and BA are the team members that interact with

17
00:00:51.0 --> 00:00:54.0
stakeholders and leaders the most throughout the project

18
00:00:54.0 --> 00:00:57.0
when both brawls are interacting with the same

19
00:00:57.0 --> 00:01:00.0
stakeholders and often does it

20
00:01:00.0 --> 00:01:03.0
need to collaborate tightly I miss interactions

21
00:01:03.0 --> 00:01:06.0
to keep stakeholder engagement high

22
00:01:06.0 --> 00:01:09.0
the stakeholders typically have full-time roles outside

23
00:01:09.0 --> 00:01:12.0
of the project so keeping the engagement strong

24
00:01:12.0 --> 00:01:15.0
get not burdensome is a key element

25
00:01:15.0 --> 00:01:18.0
next - changing priorities is a key failure

26
00:01:18.0 --> 00:01:21.0
points. how teams handle changing priorities

27
00:01:21.0 --> 00:01:24.0
can have a huge impact on if

28
00:01:24.0 --> 00:01:27.0
Value gets delivered on projects this failure point

29
00:01:27.0 --> 00:01:30.0
also points back to stakeholder involvement.

30
00:01:30.0 --> 00:01:33.0
the PM in BA are both

31
00:01:33.0 --> 00:01:36.0
heavily involved in managing priorities with

32
00:01:36.0 --> 00:01:40.0
stakeholders and influencing stakeholders on prioritization.

33
00:01:40.0 --> 00:01:43.0
and last - changing requirements.

34
00:01:43.0 --> 00:01:46.0
changing requirements can be a good thing or

35
00:01:46.0 --> 00:01:49.0
a bad thing. in bracing changing

36
00:01:49.0 --> 00:01:52.0
requirements can lead to a competitive advantage

37
00:01:52.0 --> 00:01:55.0
of the changes are result of learning more

38
00:01:55.0 --> 00:01:58.0
about what customers and users needs are

39
00:01:58.0 --> 00:02:01.0
at the same time if the project can’t

40
00:02:01.0 --> 00:02:04.0
seem to deliver anything do the starts and stops

41
00:02:04.0 --> 00:02:07.0
with constant changes , this can be to failure

42
00:02:07.0 --> 00:02:10.0
the PM and BA

43
00:02:10.0 --> 00:02:13.0
collaborate heavily on helping stakeholders in the team ,

44
00:02:13.0 --> 00:02:16.0
identify and manage requirements

45
00:02:16.0 --> 00:02:19.0
into pieces of work. these deliverables

46
00:02:19.0 --> 00:02:22.0
if not well defined can be delivered in

47
00:02:22.0 --> 00:02:25.0
increments that make requirements change less risky

48
00:02:25.0 --> 00:02:28.0
while leveraging change for a competitive advantage

49
00:02:28.0 --> 00:02:31.0
Pat PM and Bailey BA start getting

50
00:02:31.0 --> 00:02:34.0
into deep discussions on what does success

51
00:02:34.0 --> 00:02:37.0
mean on a project anyway

52
00:02:37.0 --> 00:02:40.0
is it when a project is delivered on schedule

53
00:02:40.0 --> 00:02:43.0
within budget results in a working product

54
00:02:43.0 --> 00:02:46.0
or meets the business intent

55
00:02:46.0 --> 00:02:49.0
they determine that the best approach for them is

56
00:02:49.0 --> 00:02:52.0
to collaborate on the finance successful projects with stakeholders

57
00:02:52.0 --> 00:02:55.0
the business intent maybe to

58
00:02:55.0 --> 00:02:58.0
beat a competitor to market was sacrificing quality

59
00:02:58.0 --> 00:03:01.0
and cost time is most important

60
00:03:01.0 --> 00:03:04.0
to success or the product

61
00:03:04.0 --> 00:03:07.0
working at a determined quality level with customer delight

62
00:03:07.0 --> 00:03:10.0
may be far more important than cost and schedule

63
00:03:10.0 --> 00:03:13.0
most leaders want cost schedule and

64
00:03:13.0 --> 00:03:16.0
quality while delayed in the customer but

65
00:03:16.0 --> 00:03:19.0
it’s important to know which is leading the success equation

66
00:03:19.0 --> 00:03:22.0
Pat and Bailey has found that this

67
00:03:22.0 --> 00:03:25.0
is dramatically changed how they work and collaborate
