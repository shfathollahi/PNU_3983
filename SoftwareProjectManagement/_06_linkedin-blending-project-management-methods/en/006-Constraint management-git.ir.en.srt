1

00:00:00,08 --> 00:00:04,07
- Time, cost, scope; all these constraints



2

00:00:04,07 --> 00:00:07,09

can feel overwhelming, but don't despair,



3

00:00:07,09 --> 00:00:10,01

the Waterfall Project Methodology



4

00:00:10,01 --> 00:00:12,03

has to manage all three constraints



5

00:00:12,03 --> 00:00:14,05

throughout the whole project.



6

00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:16,07

Since Waterfall is a methodology



7

00:00:16,07 --> 00:00:19,01

based on defined processes,



8

00:00:19,01 --> 00:00:21,00

the steps to manage those constraints



9

00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:25,04

are laid out for you across each phase of the lifecycle.



10

00:00:25,04 --> 00:00:27,03

So let's look at each constraint,



11

00:00:27,03 --> 00:00:31,07

and the tools at your disposal to effectively manage it.



12

00:00:31,07 --> 00:00:35,02

Let's start with time management in Waterfall.



13

00:00:35,02 --> 00:00:37,03

There are tools for this and the first tool



14

00:00:37,03 --> 00:00:39,02

that you should look at and implement



15

00:00:39,02 --> 00:00:42,03

is the work breakdown structure or WBS.



16

00:00:42,03 --> 00:00:44,01

The work breakdown structure is simply



17

00:00:44,01 --> 00:00:46,07

you defining with your team members



18

00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:50,09

all of the major pieces of work that need to be completed,



19

00:00:50,09 --> 00:00:53,00

to get to your end goal.



20

00:00:53,00 --> 00:00:55,06

Next, you'll take this work breakdown structure



21

00:00:55,06 --> 00:00:59,08

and you will estimate the tasks and define those tasks,



22

00:00:59,08 --> 00:01:01,04

and make sure that everybody knows



23

00:01:01,04 --> 00:01:03,04

exactly what has to happen



24

00:01:03,04 --> 00:01:07,07

to get that particular item of work completed.



25

00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:10,09

Next, you'll start by sequencing those tasks.



26

00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:13,06

There's a logical order to doing everything.



27

00:01:13,06 --> 00:01:16,04

For example, if you're painting a room in your house,



28

00:01:16,04 --> 00:01:19,05

it makes sense to tape the edges of the wall



29

00:01:19,05 --> 00:01:21,04

before applying paint.



30

00:01:21,04 --> 00:01:23,06

Appropriate sequencing can help you stay



31

00:01:23,06 --> 00:01:25,03

within your schedule boundaries



32

00:01:25,03 --> 00:01:28,02

and within your work breakdown structure.



33

00:01:28,02 --> 00:01:30,05

Finally, build a project plan.



34

00:01:30,05 --> 00:01:31,07

Gantt Chart is the way



35

00:01:31,07 --> 00:01:34,00

you normally see project plans layout,



36

00:01:34,00 --> 00:01:37,05

what that does is it takes each large item



37

00:01:37,05 --> 00:01:39,06

and all the subsequent tasks in it,



38

00:01:39,06 --> 00:01:43,03

and then it connects them over what has to happen



39

00:01:43,03 --> 00:01:45,09

first, second and third, and so forth.



40

00:01:45,09 --> 00:01:48,03

What that does then it give you an overall view



41

00:01:48,03 --> 00:01:50,09

to the schedule of your project.



42

00:01:50,09 --> 00:01:54,01

And you're managing those tasks each day



43

00:01:54,01 --> 00:01:56,09

to keep your project on schedule, on track,



44

00:01:56,09 --> 00:01:59,00

and making sure that you're getting all of the work



45

00:01:59,00 --> 00:02:01,04

in your work breakdown structure done.



46

00:02:01,04 --> 00:02:05,00

Next let's talk about scope management in Waterfall.



47

00:02:05,00 --> 00:02:08,00

So scope is another word for all the requirements



48

00:02:08,00 --> 00:02:12,00

that need to be completed to get the project done.



49

00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:13,07

So for scope management,



50

00:02:13,07 --> 00:02:15,05

you're going to use several different techniques.



51

00:02:15,05 --> 00:02:17,06

First you're going to prioritize the work.



52

00:02:17,06 --> 00:02:19,03

By prioritizing the work you're saying



53

00:02:19,03 --> 00:02:20,06

that everything is important,



54

00:02:20,06 --> 00:02:22,06

we want to get it all done,



55

00:02:22,06 --> 00:02:24,05

but if I can only do certain things



56

00:02:24,05 --> 00:02:25,09

I have to start with this one,



57

00:02:25,09 --> 00:02:27,04

and then move to this one.



58

00:02:27,04 --> 00:02:29,09

It reinforces that sequencing that you've done,



59

00:02:29,09 --> 00:02:32,06

and it establishes a priority for the work,



60

00:02:32,06 --> 00:02:34,02

to make sure you're getting everything done



61

00:02:34,02 --> 00:02:35,07

that you need to do.



62

00:02:35,07 --> 00:02:37,08

Another piece of managing your scope,



63

00:02:37,08 --> 00:02:40,00

is stakeholder management.



64

00:02:40,00 --> 00:02:41,04

You've been there before, right?



65

00:02:41,04 --> 00:02:42,07

You start on the project,



66

00:02:42,07 --> 00:02:44,05

you think you know everything that needs to be done,



67

00:02:44,05 --> 00:02:46,05

you get a certain way through



68

00:02:46,05 --> 00:02:48,04

and all of a sudden somebody comes in and says,



69

00:02:48,04 --> 00:02:50,02

hey I want you to do this, too.



70

00:02:50,02 --> 00:02:52,05

So helping your stakeholders understand



71

00:02:52,05 --> 00:02:54,05

what the scope of the project is,



72

00:02:54,05 --> 00:02:57,05

what the constraints are, in terms of time and schedule,



73

00:02:57,05 --> 00:03:01,00

can help you make sure that you don't grow,



74

00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:02,09

you don't end up with scope creep.



75

00:03:02,09 --> 00:03:06,03

Then you're going to apply change management processes.



76

00:03:06,03 --> 00:03:09,04

What I mean by this, is that every time a stakeholder



77

00:03:09,04 --> 00:03:12,05

or someone comes and says they want additional work done,



78

00:03:12,05 --> 00:03:14,09

you're going to take it through the normal process



79

00:03:14,09 --> 00:03:18,04

of review and vetting to make sure it's actually



80

00:03:18,04 --> 00:03:20,02

critical that it be included,



81

00:03:20,02 --> 00:03:24,02

to make sure any known changes then to schedule and cost



82

00:03:24,02 --> 00:03:27,05

because of this change are understood and accepted



83

00:03:27,05 --> 00:03:30,03

by your steering committee.



84

00:03:30,03 --> 00:03:33,02

Finally, you're going to prevent gold plating.



85

00:03:33,02 --> 00:03:37,02

Gold plating happens sometimes from the team itself.



86

00:03:37,02 --> 00:03:38,08

A lot of times team members,



87

00:03:38,08 --> 00:03:41,07

they start working on a project, they get excited about it,



88

00:03:41,07 --> 00:03:43,06

and they think, hey if I do this



89

00:03:43,06 --> 00:03:45,04

other little thing over here,



90

00:03:45,04 --> 00:03:48,02

it's going to be even better when we're done.



91

00:03:48,02 --> 00:03:51,02

But what that does is it also explodes your scope,



92

00:03:51,02 --> 00:03:52,09

so you're going to have to keep an eye on that



93

00:03:52,09 --> 00:03:54,06

as a project manager,



94

00:03:54,06 --> 00:03:57,08

to make sure that everything that's being done



95

00:03:57,08 --> 00:04:00,08

is something that was requested and absolutely required



96

00:04:00,08 --> 00:04:02,03

and it isn't a nice to have



97

00:04:02,03 --> 00:04:05,00

like most of your gold plating items are.



98

00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:08,07

Finally, let's talk about cost management in Waterfall.



99

00:04:08,07 --> 00:04:11,06

Cost is the most straight forward of the constraints



100

00:04:11,06 --> 00:04:12,09

to keep an eye on,



101

00:04:12,09 --> 00:04:16,07

because it's everything form your resource tracking



102

00:04:16,07 --> 00:04:19,08

to external vendor charges.



103

00:04:19,08 --> 00:04:22,09

So one of the key things to do to manage this,



104

00:04:22,09 --> 00:04:25,03

is to make sure that all of the members of your team



105

00:04:25,03 --> 00:04:26,08

are tracking their time.



106

00:04:26,08 --> 00:04:29,06

And then every week you're going to want to compare



107

00:04:29,06 --> 00:04:30,08

the set of tasks,



108

00:04:30,08 --> 00:04:32,06

the amount of time you thought it was going to take



109

00:04:32,06 --> 00:04:34,02

or you estimated it would take,



110

00:04:34,02 --> 00:04:36,01

verus how much it actually took.



111

00:04:36,01 --> 00:04:38,04

Then you'll compare that to your projected schedule



112

00:04:38,04 --> 00:04:40,07

and you'll make sure that they're in alignment.



113

00:04:40,07 --> 00:04:41,09

And then finally you'll gather



114

00:04:41,09 --> 00:04:44,03

all the hards costs from your vendors,



115

00:04:44,03 --> 00:04:47,00

invoices you're getting from other suppliers.



116

00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:49,05

Make sure that everything is adding up



117

00:04:49,05 --> 00:04:52,00

to the totals you expected when you established



118

00:04:52,00 --> 00:04:53,06

your project budget.



119

00:04:53,06 --> 00:04:56,07

Waterfall Project Management gives you many tools to use



120

00:04:56,07 --> 00:04:58,08

to manage your triple constraints.



121

00:04:58,08 --> 00:05:01,01

Using these tools can help you stay



122

00:05:01,01 --> 00:05:04,07

within your time, cost, and scope boundaries.
